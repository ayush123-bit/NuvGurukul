# Food Donation System API

This project is a food donation system that connects restaurants, charities, and volunteers to help reduce food waste and provide surplus food to those in need. The system includes user authentication, food posting, food request, delivery confirmation, and more.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB (locally or use MongoDB Atlas)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ayush123-bit/NuvGurukul.git

   cd NuvGurukul/backend

   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project with the following content (adjust values accordingly):

   ```env
  
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
   ```

4. Run the server:

   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```

   The server will run at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Database Schema Description

### 1. User Schema (for Restaurants, Charities, and Volunteers)

The user schema stores information about users. There are three types of users in the system: restaurants, charities, and volunteers. Each user has a unique role.

```js
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: { type: String, required: true },
  email: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
  password: { type: String, required: true },
  role: { type: String, enum: ['restaurant', 'charity', 'volunteer'], required: true },
  createdAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
});
```

### 2. Food Posting Schema (for Restaurants)

This schema is used to store information about food donations created by restaurants. A food posting contains details like food name, description, quantity, expiry date, and location.

```js
const foodSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: { type: String, required: true },
  description: { type: String },
  quantity: { type: Number, required: true },
  expiry_date: { type: Date, required: true },
  location: { type: String, required: true },  // Store location as latitude,longitude
  restaurant: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User', required: true },
  createdAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
});
```

### 3. Food Request Schema (for Charities)

Charities can request food from the posted food donations. This schema stores the request details and references the charity user and food post.

```js
const foodRequestSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  food: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Food', required: true },
  charity: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User', required: true },
  status: { type: String, enum: ['pending', 'approved', 'rejected'], default: 'pending' },
  requestedAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
});
```

### 4. Volunteer Assignment Schema (for Restaurants)

Restaurants can assign volunteers to food deliveries. This schema keeps track of which volunteer is assigned to which food delivery.

```js
const volunteerAssignmentSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  food: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Food', required: true },
  volunteer: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User', required: true },
  assignedAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
  status: { type: String, enum: ['assigned', 'in-progress', 'completed'], default: 'assigned' },
});
```

## API Documentation

The API is structured around three user roles: **restaurant**, **charity**, and **volunteer**. Each role has access to different sets of endpoints. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to running each endpoint in sequence.

---

### 1. Register Users

Use this endpoint to create users for each role (restaurant, charity, and volunteer).

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/auth/register`  
**Method:** `POST`  
**URL:** `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/register`

**Body:**
```json
{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "restaurant@example.com",
    "password": "password123",
    "role": "restaurant"
}
```

Repeat with different emails and role values to create users for each role (e.g., charity, volunteer).

---

### 2. Log In to Get JWT Tokens

Log in to retrieve a JWT token for each user, which will be required for authorization in subsequent requests.

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/auth/login`  
**Method:** `POST`  
**URL:** `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login`

**Body:**
```json
{
    "email": "restaurant@example.com",
    "password": "password123"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
    "token": "<jwt_token>"
}
```

Note: Copy this token, as it will be used in the `Authorization` header for other requests. Repeat this step for each user type (restaurant, charity, volunteer).

---

### 3. Create Food Posting (Restaurant Only)

A restaurant can create a food posting using their JWT token. Include the token in the `Authorization` header.

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/food`  
**Method:** `POST`  
**URL:** `http://localhost:3000/api/food`  
**Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <restaurant_token>`

**Body:**
```json
{
    "name": "Surplus Sandwiches",
    "description": "Fresh sandwiches from today's stock",
    "quantity": 10,
    "expiry_date": "2024-12-31",
    "location": "40.7128,-74.0060"
}
```

---

### 4. Get Available Food Postings (Charity Only)

A charity user can retrieve a list of available food postings. Use the charity JWT token.

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/food`  
**Method:** `GET`  
**URL:** `http://localhost:3000/api/food`  
**Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <charity_token>`

**Response:** A list of food postings marked as "Available".

---

### 5. Request Pickup for Food (Charity Only)

The charity user can request a pickup for a specific food posting by using its ID. Replace `{id}` with the actual food posting ID.

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/food/{id}/request`  
**Method:** `POST`  
**URL:** `http://localhost:3000/api/food/{id}/request`  
**Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <charity_token>`

---

### 6. Approve or Reject Food Request (Restaurant Only)

The restaurant can approve or reject food requests from charities. Replace `{id}` with the actual food posting ID.

#### Approve Request:
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/food/{id}/approve`  
**Method:** `POST`  
**URL:** `http://localhost:3000/api/food/{id}/approve`  
**Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <restaurant_token>`

#### Reject Request:
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/food/{id}/reject`  
**Method:** `POST`  
**URL:** `http://localhost:3000/api/food/{id}/reject`  
**Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <restaurant_token>`

---

### 7. Assign Volunteer (Restaurant Only)

The restaurant user can assign a volunteer to a food posting. Replace `{id}` with the food posting ID and `volunteer_id` with the ID of the volunteer.

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/food/{id}/assign-volunteer`  
**Method:** `POST`  
**URL:** `http://localhost:3000/api/food/{id}/assign-volunteer`  
**Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <restaurant_token>`

**Body:**
```json
{
    "volunteer_id": "<volunteer_user_id>"
}
```

---

### 8. Confirm Delivery (Volunteer Only)

The volunteer can confirm the delivery of a food posting. Replace `{id}` with the food posting ID.

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/food/{id}/confirm-delivery`  
**Method:** `POST`  
**URL:** `http://localhost:3000/api/food/{id}/confirm-delivery`
